# Project LDSA Group 20
Four measurements each for both Strong and Weak scaling were carried out. The notebooks are named accordingly to how many workers were used in the test. 
For thoroughly commented code, see file ‘Strong_scaling_1.ipynb’, which is used as the initial measurement for both the strong and weak scaling experiments.

Tests using Scala, in order to compare their performance with our PySpark solution, are kept in the separate folder named 'Scala'.
